# AGILE EXPERIENCE: Group 7

- CS-358 - Software Engineering Principles

- Spring 2020

# Project Information
Goal:
-----

- Design a fully functioning system that allows professors and student instructors to easily grade and re-grade student labs, view   and add notes attached to the labs, and view the skills checklists for the section the lab belongs to.


Group Members:
-------------
  1. Kendra Aumann-Weyenberg (Scrum Master)
  2. Brandon Schmidt (Tech Lead)
  3. Libby Walther (Product Owner)
  4. Tanner Bakken
  5. Adam Crane
  6. Michael Lee
  7. Casey Reiner


Completed Functionality:
------------------------
  - Search by Student Name, Professor Name, or Class
  - Grade and re-grade student labs using a point score within a range or Complete/Incomplete value
  - View, enter, and delete lab notes
  - View and check off skills that are stored in a skills list for each class section
  
  
Software Used:
--------------
  - MySQL Workbench with a Maria Database
  - FileZilla to access the server
  - Visual Studio Code (php, JavaScript, HTML) for web pages and database interactions
  
Visual Studio Code Extensions:
------------------------------
  - ESLint by Dirk Baeumer
  - GitHub by KristerPeter
  - GitHub Pull Requests and Issues by GitHub

# Build Instructions
  
**1. Database Build Instructions:**

  1. Create the database and tables in MySQL Workbench by running the script (linked below) in MySQL: [Database Creation Scripts](https://github.com/schmidtb2779/SEPAgileProject/tree/master/Database_Build_Instructions)      
  2. After the tables have been created, load the table data by running these scripts: [Database Data Scripts](/sql_scripts)
 
 
**2. Program Files/Source Code Build Instructions:**

  - **NOTE:** While we used Visual Studio Code, one should be able to use any source code editor that handles HTML, CSS, php, and Javascript files. 
  1. Once a source code editor is chosen, **EITHER** 
  
  2. **(a)** Clone this repository into the editor if GitHub is supported **OR** 
  
     **(b)** Download all of the files (15 in total) saved in this [folder](https://github.com/schmidtb2779/SEPAgileProject/tree/master/Visual_Studio_Code_Files), ensuring that all file names remain the same. Once all the files are downloaded, add them into the source code editor.
         

  3. Once the database has been setup and all files are in the source code editor, our whole project will have been replicated.
