AGILE EXPERIENCE: Group 7

CS-358 - Software Engineering Principles

Spring 2020


Goal: Design a fully functioning system that allows professors and student instructors to easily grade and re-grade student labs, view      and add notes attached to the labs, and view the skills checklists for the section the lab belongs to.


Group Members:
  Kendra Aumann-Weyenberg (Scrum Master),
  Brandon Schmidt (Tech Lead),
  Libby Walther (Product Owner),
  Tanner Bakken,
  Adam Crane,
  Michael Lee, and
  Casey Reiner


Completed Functionality:
  Search by Student Name, Professor Name, or Class,
  Grade and re-grade student labs using a point score within a range or Complete/Incomplete value,
  View, enter, and delete lab notes, and
  View and check off skills that are stored in a skills list for each class section
  
  
Software Used:
  MySQL Workbench with a Maria Database,
  FileZilla to access the server, and 
  Visual Studio Code (php, JavaScript, HTML) for web pages and database interactions
  
Visual Studio Code Extensions:
  ESLint by Dirk Baeumer,
  GitHub by KristerPeter, and
  GitHub Pull Requests and Issues by GitHub

Database Build Instructions:

  1.) Create the database and tables in MySQL Workbench by running the script (linked below) in MySQL:
  https://github.com/schmidtb2779/SEPAgileProject/tree/master/Database_Build_Instructions
          
 2.) After the tables have been created, load the table data by running these scripts:

Program Files/Source Code Build Instructions:

  While we used Visual Studio Code, one should be able to use any source code editor that handles HTML, CSS, php, and Javascript files.   Once an editor is chosen, either (A) Clone this repository into the editor if GitHub is supported or (B) Download all of the files    
  saved in the folder linked below, ensuring all names stay the same. Once all the files are downloaded, add them into the code editor.

  Once the database has been setup and all files are in the source code editor, our whole project will have been replicated.
